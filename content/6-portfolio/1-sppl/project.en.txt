Title: Schiller Park Public Library

Text: 

<p>Working at the Schiller Park Public Library as the computer clerk, part of my responsibility was the update the current website. However, seeing that it was made more than a decade ago, and updating required delving into piles of unorganized code, I was started making a whole new site. I was responsible for everything from the design to development, to information architecture. Built on Wordpress, I focused on making it as useful as possible to our current patrons, as well as making it easy for anyone to update.</p>
